// let object = { first: [1] };: Here, you're creating an object named object with a property first that holds an array containing the element 1.

// let numArray = object["first"];: This line assigns a reference to the array [1] to the variable numArray. Note that this reference points to the same array as the one inside the object.

// numArray.push(2);: You're using the push method to add the value 2 to the array referenced by numArray. Since numArray refers to the same array as object["first"], this operation modifies the array inside the object as well.

// console.log(numArray); // => "[1, 2]": This prints the content of the numArray, which is now [1, 2].

// console.log(object);: This prints the entire object, including the properties and their values. Since both numArray and object["first"] reference the same array, you will see that the array inside the object has also been modified to [1, 2]. 

let object = { first: [1] };
let numArray = object["first"];
numArray.push(2);

console.log(numArray); //  => "[1, 2]"
console.log(object);  // =>  { first: [ 1, 2 ] }
